Livereload automatically refreshes your web app or web site page when you save file changes. With Livereload, you can have your web site/app page reload automatically when you save a file after a change. Manual refreshing can be a chore and a time killer most especially when you are making "try-observe-try" modifications, or you have a short deadline.

# USAGE
================================================================================
1.	Extract the downloaded package (probably "livereload-master") and rename to simply "livereload".

2.	Place the "livereload" folder in your web site/app root directory.

3.	Place a <script> tag in your page to reference "livereload.js"
	e.g. <script type="text/javascript" src="livereload.js"></script>

4.	[Optional] Edit "livereload.xml" to achieve any of the following intents: 
	-> Specify the directory path to which you want to limit livereload.
	-> Add directory and file paths (relative to your site root) that you want livereload to ignore when checking for changes.

5.	[Optional] Inside "livereload.js", edit the ROOT_DIR variable to have the value of the path to the directory which you want livereload.js to use as the site root (otherwise, all livereload-related URLs will simply be prefixed by "/", which references the server-configured document root).

6.	Launch or reload your page to activate "livereload.js".


# NOTES
================================================================================
-> Livereload is currently available for PHP only. Plans for C# underway.
-> Livereload comes bundled with jQuery and loads it dynamically if jQuery is not available on the page.
-> Livereload uses a few external php library classes as indicated by the PHP includes at the top of "livereload.php".
