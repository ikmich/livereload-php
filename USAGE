# USAGE
================================================================================
1.	Place the "livereload" folder in your web site/app root directory.

2.	Place a <script> tag in your page to reference "livereload.js"
	e.g. <script type="text/javascript" src="livereload.js"></script>

3.	[Optional] Edit "livereload.xml" to: 
	-> Specify the directory path to which you want to limit livereload.
	-> Add directory and file paths (relative to your site root) that you want livereload to ignore when checking for changes.

4.	[Optional] Inside "livereload.js", edit the ROOT_DIR variable to have the value of the path to the directory which you want livereload.js to use as the site root (otherwise, all liverelaod URLs will simply be prefixed by "/").

4.	Launch or reload your page to activate "livereload.js".


# NOTES
================================================================================
-> Livereload comes bundled with jQuery and loads it dynamically if jQuery is not available on the page.
-> Livereload uses a few external php library classes as indicated by the includes at the top of "livereload.php"
